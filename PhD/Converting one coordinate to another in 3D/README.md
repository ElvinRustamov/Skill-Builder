# Transforming 3D Coordinates Between Frames Using Krylov Angles

This repository contains an academic report that explains how to convert a point from one 3D coordinate system to another using **Krylov (Euler–Krylov) angles** and rotation matrices.

The material is written at an **undergraduate engineering / computer science level**, assuming only basic linear algebra knowledge, and is suitable for coursework, self-study, or reference in robotics, computer graphics, and simulation contexts.
